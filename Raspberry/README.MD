# Raspberry Pi remote Access

This is an extended README for any new editing for the Raspberry Pi. This component is the main terminal for the software of the website controller.

## Getting Started first 
To make use of the Raspberry Pi without trying to play with it directly we can access it virtually with our own devices.
1. First we must be connected to the same wifi.
    #### WiFi and Connections
    - **WiFi name**: downRobotRoom
    - **Password**:  robotsRcool

2. Second we must enter our own computers terminal, within it we input the code:

```
bash
ssh ormo-bot@192.169.1.145
Password: Robot

```
3. Third is up to the developer to edit. A full explanation on how to use ssh is lengthy, here is a playlist explaining how to use it.
